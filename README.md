This repository documents the solutions and methodologies our team used to solve various challenges across multiple categories, including:  

- **Cryptography** 🛡️ — Reverse engineering, RSA exploits, and custom ciphers.  
- **Forensics** 🔍 — File analysis, metadata extraction, and memory forensics.  
- **Web Exploitation** 🌐 — SQL injections, XSS, and authentication bypasses.  
- **Reverse Engineering** 🔄 — Decompilation, debugging, and binary exploitation.  
- **Miscellaneous** 🎭 — Steganography, encoding schemes, and OSINT challenges.  

Each challenge write-up includes:  
- A brief problem statement (without violating CTF rules).  
- Step-by-step analysis of how we approached the challenge.  
- Scripts, payloads, and tools used.  
- Lessons learned and takeaways.
