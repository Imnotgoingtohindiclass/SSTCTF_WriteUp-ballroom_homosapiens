- **Reverse Engineering** 🔄 — Decompilation, debugging, and binary exploitation.  
- **Miscellaneous** 🎭 — Steganography, encoding schemes, and general problem-solving.  
- **OSINT** 🕵️ — Open-source intelligence gathering, reconnaissance, and information extraction.  
- **PWN** 💣 — Binary exploitation, buffer overflows, and privilege escalation.  

Each challenge write-up includes:
