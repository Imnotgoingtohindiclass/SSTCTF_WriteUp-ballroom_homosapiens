# Hidden in Discord
**Difficulty: Easy**
### Challenge:
I sent the flag somewhere in the Discord server, can't remember where though...

## Solution:
No extensions required (looking at you [vencord](https://vencord.dev)).

What is a feature that not many people know about... It is the feature about [the text channel in voice channel](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412085582359-Text-Channels-Text-Chat-In-Voice-Channels)!

Hence, hover over the only voice channel in the server and click on the chat icon.

You should find this [message](https://discord.com/channels/1331800236120735835/1331800236732977185/1336320716525535283) after scrolling up a bit:

Clicking on the [link](https://pastebin.com/R6VQyQ27) should redirect you to a pastebin with the flag **sstctf{d1scord_link5_ar3_n0t_what_th3y_seem_l1k3}**.
